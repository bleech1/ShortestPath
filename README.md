# Shortest Path around Middlebury College

## Goals/reasoning behind this project
* I've had many debates with friends about the fastest way around campus, so I've decided to, once and for all, know the fastest route.
* There is a Google sheet that I have given access to a few of my friends where times between two adjacent points can be recorded
* Another sheet calculates the average of these times
* shortestPath.py uses this data to find the data between any two points chosen by the user

## How to use
* To run this CLI, run shortestPath.py
* A list of all locations will print out along with their ID.  Choose enter your starting ID and then your ending ID
* Your ideal path and estimated time will be outputted

## Future goals

* I want to show a map of where all the points are around campus
* I want to create a web app (or phone app) that will allow users to check distances between points not using the command line
* I want to create an interface where users can input their own times between points to help crowdsource/get more reliable data
* I want to allow users to propose new points to add that they believe would be valuable
